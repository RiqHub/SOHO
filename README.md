## üéØ Project Goal
- Design and configure a small office network that supports:
- Internet access
- Segmented departments (using VLANs)
- Central DHCP
- Secure switch/router configurations
- Inter-VLAN communication

## üñ•Ô∏è Scenario Overview
We are tasked with setting up a network for a small company with 3 departments:
- HR (VLAN 10)
- IT (VLAN 20)
- Sales (VLAN 30)
Each department has 3-4 PCs. All devices must have dynamic IPs

## üß± Network Components

- 1 Router (e.g., Cisco 2911)
- 2 Switches (e.g., 2960)
- 1 Server (DHCP & DNS)
- 1 ISP simulator (another router as ISP)

10 PCs (3‚Äì4 per department)

## üîß Configuration Steps

**1. Assign VLANS**
<br>
On Switch 1 4 PCs were assigned to VLAN 10 and 3 PCs were assigned to VLAN 30. G0/0 was assigned as a trunk port in order to carry VLAN traffic. The same steps were repeated on switch 2 for the cpresponding VLANs and trunk ports.

**2. Configure Inter-VLAN routing**
<br>
On the Router we set up sub-interfaces for each vlan and assigned their respective subnets.

**3. Configure DHCP**
<br>
Set the scope for each VLANs (Also set a route to the ISP for external connection *not really neccessary for this lab*)

**4. Configure Port Security**
<br>
To ensure no unauthorized devices connect to the switches we will enable port security. Repeat for other switch as well.
